# SimpleWPF

This is a simple WPF application. It is written using .NET 8. Check out the documents in the repo's `docs` folder as well as this repo's `Wiki`.

## The purpose of this repo

As is mentioned in this repo's Wiki, this repo is so I can learn how to do a CI/CD with GitHub Action and a self-hosted runner, to deploy this app as a MSIX.

I'll try using GitHub's Workflow that adds MSIX.
